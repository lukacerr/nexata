# Security Policy

This project follows an AI‑aware, privacy‑first security posture. The goal is to minimize risk from traditional software threats and AI-specific attack vectors (e.g., prompt injection, data exfiltration through tools, harmful content generation).

If you discover any risk, vulnerability, or suspicious behavior, notify the core maintainers immediately as described below.

## Scope

- Source code, configurations, build/release pipelines
- Data handled by the project (inputs, prompts, outputs, logs)
- AI/LLM workflows, tools, plugins, and integrations
- Third‑party dependencies and services used by this project

## Reporting a Vulnerability or Risk

- Do not open a public issue for security matters.
- Email the core maintainers (refer to MAINTAINERS.md).
- Use a subject like: [SECURITY] Brief description
- Include:
  - Affected component(s), version/commit
  - Description and potential impact
  - Steps to reproduce or proof of concept
  - Any logs, screenshots, or traces (redact sensitive data)
  - Your preferred contact method

## Supported Versions

- Main branch as the latest stable release are actively supported for security fixes.

## Out of Scope

- Vulnerabilities in third‑party services or dependencies should be reported upstream; still notify us if they impact this project so we can apply mitigations.

## Questions

For general security questions or to discuss hardening/AI safety practices, contact the core maintainers via the emails above.

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe.
